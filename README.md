UCLA Week 18 Homework

## Link
https://webscraper1000.herokuapp.com/savedArt?

This is a web scraping app, and will scrape articles from Catster.com.  I am working on allowing a user to add notes to saved articles, but I am having trouble getting the notes to save. The link abover is for the heroku version which only has the working parts, scraping, saving, and deleting articles.
